# Prometheus Tron Brute Force
This script is designed to automatically generate seed phrases and check balances for Tron networks. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, the wallet's information (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) is logged and saved to a file named result.txt.

The script will continuously generate seed phrases and check the balances of the associated wallets. Information about each checked wallet will be logged to the console.
